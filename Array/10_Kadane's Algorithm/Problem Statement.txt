KADANE'S ALGORITHM  =>

Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.

Input:
	The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
	The description of T test cases follows. 
	The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the array. 
	The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
	Print the maximum sum of the contiguous sub-array in a separate line for each test case.

User Task:
	The task is to complete the function maxSubarraySum() which finds subarray with maximum sum.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
   -> 1 ≤ T ≤ 110
   -> 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
   -> -10^7 ≤ A[i] <= 10^7

Example:

	Input:
		2
		5
		1 2 3 -2 5
		4
		-1 -2 -3 -4

	Output:
		9
		-1

Explanation:
	Testcase 1: Max subarray sum is 9 of elements (1, 2, 3, -2, 5) which is a contiguous subarray.
