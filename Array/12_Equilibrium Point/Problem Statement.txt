EQUILIBRIUM POINT  =>

Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the first Equilibium Point in the array. 
Equilibrium Point in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of elements after it.

Input:
	The first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. 
	Then T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the size of the array. 
	Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array A.

Output:
	For each test case in a new line print the index of the first Equilibrium Point. 
	The output should be based on 1 based indexing. 
	If no such point exists print -1.

User Task:
	The task is to complete the function equilibriumPoint() which takes the array and N as input parameters and returns the point of equilibrium. 
	Return -1 if no such point exists.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
   -> 1 <= T <= 100
   -> 1 <= N <= 10^6
   -> 1 <= A[i] <= 10^8

Example:

	Sample Input:
			2
			1	
			1
			5
			1 3 5 2 2

	Sample Output:
			1
			3

Explanation:
	Testcase 1: Since its the only element hence its the only equilibrium point.
	Testcase 2: For second test case equilibrium point is at position 3 as elements before it (1+3) = elements after it (2+2).
