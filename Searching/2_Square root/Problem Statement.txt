Square root =>
 
Given an integer x. The task is to find the square root of x. If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(√x).

Input:
	First line of input contains number of testcases T. For each testcase, the only line contains the number x.

Output:
	For each testcase, print square root of given integer.

Your Task:
	The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() which should return the square root of given number x.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
   -> 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000
   -> 1 ≤ x ≤ 107

Example:

	Input:
		2
		5
		4

	Output:
		2
		2

	Explanation:
		Testcase 1: Since, 5 is not perfect square, so floor of square_root of 5 is 2.
		Testcase 2: Since, 4 is a perfect square, so its square root is 2.
